This paper discuss an experimental project which aims to explore the performance of different machine learning models in predicting the primary function (Residential, Commercial, Industrial and Public Services) of a building based on the LiDAR representation of its rooftop.

We will first present the dataset used in the project and explain the pre-processing applied in order to extract the features.

 We will then examine a features-oriented approach in which we will experiment with two well-known learning algorithms, kNN and Tree Predictors. 
 
 Finally we will shift our perspective by exploiting different Convolutional Neural Networks to which we will provide the rooftopsâ€™ LiDAR point clouds as if they were one-channel images.

The different approaches will be compared in the final chapter in which we will also discuss some next steps that could be taken in order to further improve the whole project.
